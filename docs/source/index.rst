Welcome to dlex's documentation!
================================

dlex is an open source framework for machine learning scientific experiment. Features include:

- Configuration-based experiment setup. Less code for more reproducibility
- Pytorch or Tensorflow 2.0 or scikit-learn as backend with similar training flow
- Efficiently log, report and analyze experiment results
- Cross-platform GUI for monitoring experiments, either local or remote sever (Electron-based)
